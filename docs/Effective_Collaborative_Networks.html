## Evaluation of Network Bottlenecking and Centrality as Metrics for Effective Collaborative Networks
#### Naren Sivagnanadasan and Tanishq Dubey
###### ECE 498LV - University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
---
## Motivation 
- Some of the most interesting networks are those where nodes work together to accomplish a higher goal

- Designing such networks is difficult and typically are designed with intuition rather than theory 
      - Many when setting up organizations centralize broad decision making in a few people rather 
      than a large committee 

      - Neural Nets are designed to extract as much information early on and then condense into a few nodes 
      at the end 

- Would be nice to have topological metrics in addition to performance metrics to help design new networks
      - Could help introduce formalism into the design of complex collaborative networks

## Collaborative Networks

Networks where nodes in the network work together or symbiotically to accomplish goals

_"A collaborative network (CN) is constituted by a variety of entities (e.g.,organizations 
and people) that are largely autonomous, geographically distributed, and heterogeneous in
terms of their: operating environment, culture, social capital, and goals. Nevertheless 
these entities collaborate to better achieve common or compatible goals, and whose 
interactions are supported by computer network. "_ - Camarinha-Matos et. al 2004 

Examples:
      - Open Source Projects
      - Polymath project
      - Organizations
      - Swarm Systems 
      - Some transportation networks (e.g. airline partnerships like the Star Alliance)
      - Supply Chains 
      - By extension: Neural Nets, distributed systems etc.

Designing efficient collaborative networks is a really important problem

## Artificial Neural Networks

Directed Acyclic (in the simple case) Computational Graphs 
      
$$y = w_5^T F(w_4, b_4, F(...)) + b_5$$
$$\text{where } F(w, b, x) = relu(w^Tx +b) \text{ and } relu(x) = max(0,x)$$  


- Weighting of various inputs aggregated and passed forward if passes threshold

- The nodes work together each focused on specific details to make an inference

- Trained via Gradient Decent

- Applied to Function Approximation, Pattern Recognition and more

- Architecture design heavily dependent on intuition

## Evaluating Bottlenecking and Centrality as Possible Design Metrics 
Given some evidence in the literature and also the intuition that many apply when designing collaborative systems we seek to 
evaluate if bottlenecks are a signifier of effective collaborative networks.

## Related Work

#### Yu et. al, 2007 
      - Finds that bottlenecks in information flow (as measured by Betweenness Centrality) in protein 
      regulation networks are correlated with essential genes  

#### Radford et. al, 2017 
      - Finds that Artificial Neural Nets for text analysis will naturally centralize particular roles
      in the network (e.g. sentiment analysis is handled by 1 node) and those nodes have a large impact 
      on the output of the network

#### Guimariles et. al, 1995
      - Found similar role centralization in small neural nets used for predicting chemical properties
      of organic compounds

## Our Approach

- We evaluated a couple classes of networks: random, from nature (airport networks and ecological networks) and man-made
networks (ANNs) for their bottleneck properties

- We use natural networks as a signifier of what self organizing systems tend to create and 
as a baseline effective network to compare against
      - Airports being a more collaborative network than the ecological network

- We then train a couple ANNs with varying architectures to see what flow and bottlenecking develops

- As a control we run the same evaluation on random networks

## Cursory Performance Evaluation of MLPs
- Evaluating 3 Multi-Layer Perceptrons with roughly the same amount of nodes (roughly 3000)
      - Discrepancies in number of nodes due to trying to preserve the rate of funneling and to make math work

- Narrowing Network
      - 784 -> 800 -> 600 -> 400 -> 200 -> 10
      - Accuracy: 85% on MNIST

- Constant Width Network
      - 784 -> 500 -> 500 -> 500 -> 500 -> 10
      - Accuracy: 58% on MNIST

- Widening Network
      - 784 -> 200 -> 400 -> 600 -> 800 -> 10
      - Accuracy: 61% on MNIST

## Metrics Used

- Betweenness Centrality (as a signifier of Bottlenecking)

- PageRank Centrality (as a comparison metric)

- In/Out Degree Distribution (as a comparison metric)

- All(In/Out) Pairs Max Flow (visual understanding of flow)
---
## Betweenness Centrality 

$$
x_i = \sum_p n_p^i
$$
Number of geodesic paths through a node i
---
## PageRank Centrality
$$
\boldsymbol x = \boldsymbol D(\boldsymbol D - \alpha \boldsymbol A)^{-1} \boldsymbol 1
$$

$$
\boldsymbol D_{ii} = max(1,k_i)
$$

Centrality derived from neighbors proportional to their out-degree

---
## All (In/Out) Pairs Max Flow

-  All pairs max flow: maximum flow value between every pair of nodes in a
directed graph on n nodes, m edges, and capacities in the range

- Augmented for neural nets to only evaluate inputs and outputs pairs

## ANNs Analysis 
- 3 Networks of near similar number nodes and edges trained on the task of converting numbers from binary representation to decimal:
      
      - Narrowing 
            - Aggressive narrowing of hidden layers the network width 
            - 10 -> 25 -> 20 -> 15-> 10 -> 1
      - Constant Size
            - Hidden layer width remains constant 
            - 10 -> 18 -> 18 -> 18 -> 18 -> 1
      - Widening
            - Hidden Layers begin narrow and widen 
            - 10 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 25 -> 1

## What Did We Learn
- The betweenness centrality distribution is a indeed a signifier of good collaborative networks 

      - Bud not in the way we were expecting

      - Both the airport network and the narrowing ANN feature few true bottlenecks (less variance in the betweenness centrality)

      - Other networks feature more bottlenecks and they are "less collaborative" networks

      - However this still may be consistent with the role centrality found in Radford et. al, and 

-  All pairs max flow comparison between ANNs show that given early width in the network encourages the extraction of more features and 
leads to the network better utilizing the full network width better later in the network

      - Smaller early layers lead flow being concentrated layer in a percentage of the width provided 

      - Confirms the intuition in designing ANNs, start wide and narrow, but not for the reasons people think

      - May show that flow tends to centralize and therefore ANNs should be wider earlier to leave enough width at the end  
---
## Issues in Conducting This Work

- Due to computational limitations, evaluation of full scale ANNs were not possible 
      - Small networks (MLP with 90% on MNIST) has over 1500 nodes and 420000 edges

- Issues with our analysis approach made it difficult to analyze natural neural nets (e.g. mouse visual cortex) which 
a reasonable network to compare against
---
## Future Work
- Evaluate the flow and centrality on full scale networks
      
      - Would involve implementing some sort of parallel evaluation (i.e. CUDA) to make it more feasible 

- Run analysis on natural neural nets

- Since we see narrowing in all of the neural nets, running an experiment where sufficient width is provided early and kept constant and see how the flow 

- Develop/Apply a general notion of role/role centralization for networks as another metric to evaluate

- Develop/Apply a notion of effectiveness for Organizational Networks to compare different organization hierarchies
in this context

      - Similarly for other collaborative networks: academic collaboration, open source governance, swarm systems etc.  

- Results warrant further study
      -  There is the potential to add formalism to collaborative network design
