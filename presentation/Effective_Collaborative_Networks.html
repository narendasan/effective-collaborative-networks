## Evaluation of Network Bottlenecking and Centrality as Metrics for Effective Collaborative Networks
#### Naren Sivagnanadasan and Tanishq Dubey
###### ECE 498LV - Unviersity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
---
## Motivation 
- Some of the most interesting networks are those where nodes work togther to accomplish a higher goal

- Designing such networks is difficult and typically are designed with intuition rather than theory

## Collaborative Networks
---
## Artifical Neural Networks

Directed Acyclic (in the simple case) Computational Graphs 
      
$$y = w_5^T F(w_4, b_4, F(...)) + b_5$$
$$\text{where } F(w, b, x) = relu(w^Tx +b) \text{ and } relu(x) = max[0,x]$$  


- Weighting of various inputs aggrigated and passed forward if passes threshold

- The nodes work together each focused on specific details to make an inference

- Trained via Gradient Decent (though a Non Convex)

- Applied to Function Approximation, Pattern Recognition and more

- Architecture design heaviely dependent on intuition

## Cursory Performace Evaluation of MLPs
- Evaluating 3 Multi-Layer Perceptrons with roughly the same amount of nodes (roughly 3000)
      - Descrepencies in number of nodes due to trying to preserve the rate funneling and to make math work

- Narrowing Network
      - 784 -> 800 -> 600 -> 400 -> 200 -> 10
      - Accuracy: 85% on MNIST

- Constant Width Network
      - 784 -> 500 -> 500 -> 500 -> 500 -> 10
      - Accuracy: 58% on MNIST

- Widening Network
      - 784 -> 200 -> 400 -> 600 -> 800 -> 10
      - Accuracy: 61% on MNIST

## ANNs Analysis 
- 3 Networks of near similar number nodes and edges:
      - Narrowing 
            - Aggressive narrowing of hidden layers the network width 
            - 10 -> 25 -> 20 -> 15-> 10 -> 1
      - Constant Size
            - Hidden layer width remains constant 
            - 10 -> 18 -> 18 -> 18 -> 18 -> 1
      - Widening
            - Hidden Layrs begin narrow and widen 
            - 10 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 25 -> 1

## Issues in Conducting This Work

- Due to computational limitations, evaluation of full scale ANNs were not possible 
      - Small networks (MLP with 90% on MNIST) has over 1500 nodes and 420000 edges
---
## Future Work
- Evaluate the flow and centrality on full scale networks
      - Would involve implementing some sort of parallel evaluation (i.e. CUDA) to make it more feasible
